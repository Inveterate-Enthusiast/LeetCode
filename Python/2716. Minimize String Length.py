# Given a string s, you have two types of operation:
#
# Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the left of i (if exists).
# Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the right of i (if exists).
# Your task is to minimize the length of s by performing the above operations zero or more times.
#
# Return an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.
