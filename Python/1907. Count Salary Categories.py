# Table: Accounts

# | Column Name | Type |

# | account_id  | int  |
# | income      | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
#
#
# Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:
#
# "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
# "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
# "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
# The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.
#
# Return the result table in any order.
