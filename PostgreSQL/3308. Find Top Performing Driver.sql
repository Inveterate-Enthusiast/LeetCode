Uber is analyzing drivers based on their trips. Write a solution to find the top-performing driver for each fuel type based on the following criteria:

--A driver's performance is calculated as the average rating across all their trips. Average rating should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
If two drivers have the same average rating, the driver with the longer total distance traveled should be ranked higher.
If there is still a tie, choose the driver with the fewest accidents.
Return the result table ordered by fuel_type in ascending order.
