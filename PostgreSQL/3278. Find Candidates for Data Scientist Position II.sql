+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| candidate_id | int     |
| skill        | varchar |
| proficiency  | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(candidate_id, skill) is the unique key for this table.
Each row includes candidate_id, skill, and proficiency level (1-5).
Table: Projects

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| project_id   | int     |
| skill        | varchar |
| importance   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(project_id, skill) is the primary key for this table.
Each row includes project_id, required skill, and its importance (1-5) for the project.
Leetcode is staffing for multiple data science projects. Write a solution to find the best candidate for each project based on the following criteria:

Candidates must have all the skills required for a project.
Calculate a score for each candidate-project pair as follows:
Start with 100 points
Add 10 points for each skill where proficiency > importance
Subtract 5 points for each skill where proficiency < importance
Include only the top candidate (highest score) for each project. If thereâ€™s a tie, choose the candidate with the lower candidate_id.
If there is no suitable candidate for a project, do not return that project.

Return a result table ordered by project_id in ascending order.
